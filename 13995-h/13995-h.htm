    <i>on a bench, grappling with the Epitome of</i> SPENCER.</p>

        <p>Podbury grappling with the Epitome of Spencer.</p>
    </div>

    <p><i>Podbury</i> (<i>reading aloud, with comments</i>). "For
    really to conceive the infinite divisibility of matter is
    mentally to follow out the divisions to infinity, and to do
    this would require infinite time." You're right <i>there</i>,
    old cock, and, as I haven't got it to spare, I won't trouble
    you!&mdash;um&mdash;um ... "opposite
    absurdities"&mdash;"subjective modifications" ... "ultimate
    scientific ideas, then, are all representative of ideas that
    cannot be comprehended." I could have told <i>him</i> that.
    What bally rot this Philosophy is&mdash;but I suppose I must
    peg away at it. Didn't she say she was sorry I didn't go in
    more for cultivating my mind? (<i>He looks up</i>.) Jove, here
    she comes! and yes, there's that beggar CULCHARD with her! I
    thought he'd&mdash;how the dickens did he manage to&mdash;? I
    see what <i>he's</i> after&mdash;thinks he'll cut me
    out&mdash;twice over&mdash;but he shan't this time, if I can
    help it!</p>

    <p><i>Culchard</i> (<i>to</i> Miss HYPATIA PRENDERGAST). No,
    the Modern Spirit is too earnestly intent upon solving the
    problems of existence to tolerate humour in its literature.
    Humour has served a certain purpose in its day, but that day is
    done, and I for one cannot pretend to regret its decay.</p>

    <p><i>Miss H. P</i>. Nor I. In fact, the only humour I ever
    <i>really</i> appreciated is that of the ancient classics.
    There has been no true fun since ARISTOPHANES died. At least,
    <i>I</i> think not.</p>

    <p><i>Podb</i>. (<i>catching the last sentence</i>). Oh, I say,
    come, Miss PRENDERGAST. Have you ever read "The Jumping
    Frog"?</p>

    <p><i>Miss P</i>. I was under the impression that <i>all</i>
    frogs jumped. But I never
    read&mdash;I&mdash;ah&mdash;<i>study</i>.</p>

    <p><i>Podb</i>. (<i>declining to be crushed</i>). Well, I call
    MARK TWAIN funny anyhow. But <i>I'm</i> going in for study now.
    I am&mdash;honour bright! I'm swotting up
    SPENCER&mdash;look!</p>

    <p class="author">[<i>He exhibits the volume proudly</i>.</p>

    <p><i>Miss P</i>. And are you not enchanted by the logical
    lucidity of that great thinker?</p>

    <p><i>Podb</i>. Um&mdash;I should be more enchanted if I ever
    had the faintest notion what the great thinker was driving at.
    Look here&mdash;here's a simple little sentence for you!
    <i>(Reads.)</i> "Let us therefore bear in mind the
    following:&mdash;That of the whole incident force affecting an
    aggregate, the effective force is that which remains after
    deducting the non-effective, that the temporarily effective and
    the permanently effective vary inversely, and that the molar
    and molecular changes wrought by the permanently effective
    force also vary inversely." (<i>With pathos</i>.) And that's
    only in an <i>Epitome</i>, mind you!</p>

    <p><i>Miss P</i>. Really, Mr. PODBURY, I see nothing
    particularly incomprehensible in that.</p>

    <p><i>Culch</i>. (<i>with his superior smile</i>). My dear
    PODBURY, you can hardly expect to master the Spencerian
    phraseology and habit of thought without at least <i>some</i>
    preliminary mental discipline!</p>

    <p><i>Podb</i>. (<i>nettled</i>). Oh&mdash;but <i>you</i> find
    him plain-sailing enough, I suppose?</p>

    <p><i>Culch</i>. I have certainly not encountered any
    insuperable difficulties in his works as <i>yet</i>.</p>

    <p><i>Podb</i>. Well, I'll just trouble you to explain
    <i>this</i>&mdash;wait a bit. (<i>Opens volume again</i>.) Ah,
    here we are&mdash;"And these illusive and primordial
    cognitions, or pseud-ideas, are homogeneous entities which may
    be differentiated objectively or subjectively, according as
    they are presented as Noumenon or Phenomenon. Or, in other
    words, they are only cognoscible as a colligation of
    incongruous coalescences." Now then&mdash;are you going to tell
    me you can make head or tail of all that?</p>

    <p><i>Culch</i>. (<i>perceiving that</i> Miss P. <i>is awaiting
    his reply in manifest suspense</i>). It's simple enough, my
    dear fellow, only I can't expect <i>you</i> to grasp it. It is
    merely a profound truth stated with masterly precision.</p>

    <p><i>Podb</i>. Oh, is <i>that</i> all, my dear fellow? (<i>He
    flings up his heels in an ecstasy</i>.) I <i>knew</i> I'd have
    you! Why, I made that up myself as I went along, and if
    <i>you</i> understand it, it's a jolly sight more than <i>I</i>
    do!&nbsp;&nbsp; [<i>He roars with laughter</i>.</p>

    <p><i>Miss P</i>. (<i>behind her handkerchief</i>). Mr.
    CULCHARD has evidently gone through the&mdash;the "preliminary
    mental discipline."</p>

    <p><i>Culch</i>. (<i>scarlet and sulky</i>). Of course, if Mr.
    PODBURY descends to childishness of that sort, I can't pretend
    to&mdash;</p>

    <p><i>Podb</i>. (<i>wiping his eyes</i>). But you <i>did</i>
    pretend, old chap. You said it was "profound truth" and
    "masterly precision"! I've got more profound truth where
    <i>that</i> came from. I say, I shall set up as an intellectual
    Johnny after this, and <i>get</i> you to write an Epitome of
    me. I think I pulled your leg <i>that</i> time, eh?</p>

    <p><i>Culch</i>. (<i>biting his lip</i>). When you have
    extracted sufficient entertainment from that very small joke,
    you will perhaps allow Miss PRENDERGAST to sit down and begin
    her sketch. You may not be aware that you've taken her
    place.</p>

    <p>[<i>He withdraws majestically to the parapet, while</i>
    PODBURY <i>makes way for</i> Miss P. <i>with apologies</i>.</p>

    <p><i>Podb</i>. (<i>as he leans over seat while she
    sketches</i>). I wish your brother BOB had been here&mdash;he
    would have enjoyed that!</p>

    <p><i>Miss P</i>. It was really too bad of you, though. Poor
    Mr. CULCHARD!</p>

    <p><i>Podb</i>. He shouldn't try to make me out a bigger duffer
    than I am, then. But I say, you don't <i>really</i> think it
    was too bad? Ah, you're <i>laughing</i>&mdash;you don't!</p>

    <p><i>Miss P</i>. Never mind what I really think. But you have
    got us both into sad disgrace. Mr. CULCHARD is dreadfully
    annoyed with us&mdash;look at his <i>shoulders</i>!</p>

    <p><i>Culch</i>. (<i>leaning over parapet with his back to
    them</i>). That <i>ass</i> PODBURY! To think of his taking me
    in with an idiotic trick like that! And before Her too! And
    when I had made it all right about the other evening, and was
    producing an excellent impression on the way up here. I wish I
    could hear what they were whispering about&mdash;more silly
    jokes at my expense, no doubt. Bah! as if it affected
    <i>me</i>!</p>

    <p><i>Podb</i>. (<i>to</i> Miss P.). I say, how awfully well
    you draw!</p>

    <p><i>Miss P</i>. There you betray your ignorance in Art
    matters. Sketching with me is a pastime, not a serious pursuit,
    (<i>They go on conversing in a lower tone</i>.) No,
    <i>please</i>, Mr. PODBURY. I'm quite sure he would
    never&mdash;</p>

    <p><i>Podb</i>. (<i>rises; comes up to</i> CULCHARD, <i>and
    touches his shoulder</i>). I say, old chappie&mdash;</p>

    <p><i>Culch</i>. (<i>jerking away with temper</i>). Now, look
    here, PODBURY. I'm not in the mood for any more of your
    foolery&mdash;</p>

    <p><i>Podb</i>. (<i>humbly</i>). All right, old boy. I wouldn't
    bother you, only Miss PRENDERGAST wants a figure for her
    foreground, and I said I'd ask you if you'd keep just as you
    are for a few minutes. Do you mind?</p>

    <p><i>Culch</i>. (<i>to himself</i>). Afraid she's gone too
    far&mdash;thinks she'll smooth me down! Upon my word, it would
    serve her right to&mdash;but no, I won't be petty.
    (<i>Aloud</i>.) Pray tell Miss PRENDERGAST that I have no
    immediate intention of altering my position.</p>

    <p><i>Podb</i>. Thanks awfully, old chap. I knew you'd
    oblige.</p>

    <p><i>Culch</i>. (<i>incisively</i>). I am obliging Miss
    PRENDERGAST, and her only. (<i>Raising his voice, without
    turning his head</i>.) Would you prefer me to <i>face</i> you,
    Miss PRENDERGAST?</p>

    <p><i>Miss P</i>. (<i>in tremulous tones</i>). N&mdash;no,
    thank you. It&mdash;it's so much more n&mdash;natural, don't
    you know, for you to be l&mdash;looking at the view.</p>

    <p><i>Culch</i>. As you please. (<i>To himself</i>.) Can't meet
    my eye. Good! I shall go on treating her distantly for a
    little. I wonder if I look indifferent enough from behind?
    Shall I cross one foot? Better not&mdash;she may have begun
    sketching me. If she imagines I'm susceptible to feminine
    flattery of this palpable kind, she'll&mdash;how her voice
    shook, though, when she spoke. Poor girl, she's afraid she
    offended me by laughing&mdash;and I <i>did</i> think she had
    more sense than to&mdash;but I mustn't be too hard on her. I'm
    afraid she's already beginning to think too much of&mdash;and
    with my peculiar position with Miss TROTTER&mdash;(MAUD, that
    is)&mdash;not that there's anything definite at present,
    still&mdash;(<i>Aloud</i>.) Ahem, Miss PRENDERGAST&mdash;am I
    standing as you wish? (<i>To himself</i>.) She doesn't
    answer&mdash;too absorbed, and I can't hear that
    idiot&mdash;found he hasn't scored so much after all, and gone
    off in a huff, I expect. So much the better! What a time she is
    over this, and how quiet she keeps! I wish I knew whether it
    was coquetry or&mdash;shall I turn round and see? No, I must be
    perfectly indifferent. And she <i>did</i> laugh at me. I
    distinctly saw her. Still, if she's sorry, this would be an
    excellent opportunity for&mdash;(<i>Aloud</i>.) Miss
    PRENDERGAST! (<i>No reply&mdash;louder</i>.) May I take it that
    you regret having been betrayed into momentary approbation of a
    miserable piece of flippancy? If so, let me assure
    you&mdash;(<i>Turns round&mdash;to discover that he is

    one, but sufficient to meet my modest requirements.</p>

    <p>Well, we sailed towards England, and as Mr. J.A. FROUDE has
    already explained (quoting from my own letter to King PHILIP),
    "knowing nothing of navigation," I soon made a bad shot.
    Instead of going to Tilbury, I drifted towards Cronstadt, even
    then a fortress of some consideration. I could tell you a great
    deal more, were it not that I succumbed to sea-sickness and
    gave up my command. The expedition was now, of course,
    commanded by the steward, but the duties of his unpleasant
    office left him but little time for directing an invasion.
    Well, we got within reach of England when the wind began to
    blow, and before I could hitch myself up with a marling-spike,
    every man Jack of us was ready for Davy Jones's locker!</p>

    <p>But why should I dwell upon the events of the next few days?
    We were out-manoeuvred and beaten. I myself took refuge in a
    wood of mahogany trees, and it was my delight and my privilege
    to supply the requirements of the British colony in all that
    they desired. The result of this was that I and a few personal
    friends took refuge in a forest in which mahogany trees
    flourished. It was in this leafy prison that I supplied the
    genuine old Armada mahogany "as advertised." I would be afraid
    to say how many places I supplied with wood from the Armada. I
    may hint that I know something of the tables at Westminster and
    the benches of Gray's Inn. But there, that is many years ago,
    and all I can say now is, "Heave away, boys," and "Three cheers
    for the Don, the Keys, and the Donkey." I was the Don, the keys
    were supplied to those who paid for them, and the donkeys could
    defend themselves. The Armada was not a success, and after this
    frank avowal, it seems to me that Mr. FROUDE need render no
    further explanation. Surely the story of the Spanish Invasion
    is copyright. And if it is, Mr. FROUDE has no right to tamper
    with my work, the more especially as it is immediately
    appropriated by that model of modern journalism the <i>Review
    of Reviews</i>.</p>

    <h2>MR. PUNCH'S NAVAL NOVEL.</h2>

    <blockquote>
        <p>[<i>Mr. Punch</i> has observed with much gratification
        the success of various <i>brochures</i> professing to give,
        under the disguise of retrospect, a prophetic but accurate
        account of the naval battle of the immediate future. <i>Mr.
        Punch</i> has read them carefully over and over again. For
        some time he has been living, so to speak, in the midst of
        magnificent iron-clad fleets. In vain have torpedoes been
        launched on their occasionally death-dealing mission
        against him, in vain have immense shells exploded in his
        immediate neighbourhood. Nothing, not even the ramming of
        one whole squadron by another, has succeeded in daunting
        him. He has remained immovable in the midst of an appalling
        explosion which reduced a ship's company to a heap of
        toe-nails. And now, his mind fired by the crash of conflict
        and the intoxication of almost universal slaughter, he
        proposes to show the world how a naval novel that means to
        be accurate as well as vivid, to be bought by the public in
        thousands as well as to teach useful lessons to politicians
        and sailors, ought really to be written. <i>Mr. Punch</i>
        may as well state that he has <i>not</i> submitted this
        story to any naval experts. His facts speak for themselves,
        and require no merely professional approval to enhance
        their value.]</p>
    </blockquote>

    <h3>WHO'D BE A SAILOR?</h3>

    <h3>(<i>A Story of Blood and Battle</i>.)</h3>

    <h3>CHAPTER I.</h3>

    <p>Listen, my Grandchildren! for you are mine, not indeed by
    the ridiculous accident of birth (since to speak the truth I am
    an unmarried old sea-dog), but by the far higher and more
    honourable title of having been selected by me to hear this
    yarn. You know well enough that such a tale <i>must</i> be told
    to grandchildren, and since you undoubtedly possessed
    grandparents, and have been hired at a shilling an hour to
    listen to me, I have every right to address you as I did.
    Therefore I say, my grandchildren, attend to what I am about to
    relate. You who live under the beneficent sway of the mighty
    Australo-Canado-Africo-Celto-Americo-Anglian Federation of
    Commonwealths, can have no notion of the degraded conditions
    under which I, your grandfather, and the rest of my miserable
    fellow-countrymen lived fifty years ago in the year 1892.
    Naturally you have read no books of history referring to any
    date anterior to 1902. The wretched records of ignorance,
    slavery and decrepitude have been justly expunged from your
    curriculum. Let me tell you then that a little country calling
    itself the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland at that
    time arrogated to itself the leadership of the mighty countries
    which you now call your home. You smile and refer me to a
    large-sized map on which, as you justly observe, this country
    occupies a space of not more than two square inches. Your
    surprise is intelligible, but the melancholy fact remains. All
    this has now been happily changed, and changed too in
    consequence of a war in which England (for so the country was
    often inaccurately called, except upon Scotch political
    platforms, where people naturally objected to the name) in
    which, as I say, England bore the chief part and obtained the
    decisive victory. The story of this war I am now about to
    relate to you.</p>

    <h3>CHAPTER II.</h3>

    <p>War had been declared. We had known for a long time that it
    was coming. For months past the bellicose bench of Bishops had
    been preaching war in all the Cathedrals of the land. Field
    Marshal the Duke of WOLSELEY, who was then a simple lord, had
    written articles in all the prominent American reviews, and had
    proved to demonstration that with 50,000 boys and the new
    patent revolving ammunition belt, Britain (for that too was the
    name of my late country) was ready to defy and conquer the
    world. Rear-Admiral and Lieutenant-General Sir WILLIAM T.
    STEAD, G.C.B., C.S.I., K.G., V.C.&mdash;the great journalist in
    the shade of whose colossal mounted statue we are now
    sitting&mdash;had suddenly become a convert to the doctrine
    that war is the great purifier, and had offered in a spirit of
    extraordinary self-abnegation to command both the Army and the
    Fleet in action. Volunteer corps armed with scythes,
    paper-knives, walking-sticks and umbrellas had sprung up all
    over the country, and had provided their own uniforms and
    equipment. Lord RANDOLPH CHURCHILL, father of the present Earl
    of South Africa, had been recalled to office by an alarmed
    country, and had united in his own person the offices of
    Secretary of State for War, First Lord of the Admiralty,
    Premier, Chancellor of the Exchequer and Lord Privy Seal. As a
    first step towards restoring confidence, he had, with his own
    hands, beheaded the former Prime Minister, the Marquis of
    SALISBURY, and had published a cheap and popular edition of his
    epoch-making Letters from Mashonaland. His Lordship's official
    residence had been established at the Amphitryon Club where
    they still preserve on constant relays of ice the <i>Bécassine
    bardée aux truffes</i> which Lord RANDOLPH was about to eat
    when he snubbed the united ambassadors of Germany, France,
    Austria, Russia, Italy and the Republic of Andorra. The
    immediate consequence was a declaration of war against us.</p>

    <h3>CHAPTER III.</h3>

             alt="The Explosion. " /></a> The Explosion.
    </div>

    <p>I was at that time in command of H.M.S. <i>Bandersnatch</i>,
    a vessel of nine hundred thousand horse-power, and a mean
    average displacement of four hundred thousand tons. Ah, the
    dear old <i>Bandersnatch!</i> Never can I forget the thrill of
    exquisite emotion which pervaded my inmost being as I stepped
    on board in mid-ocean. Everything was in apple-pie order.
    Bulkheads, girders, and beams shone like glass in the noonday
    sun. The agile torpedo-catchers had been practising their
    sports, and I could not resist a feeling of intense pride when
    I learnt that only fifty of these heroic fellows had that
    morning perished owing to the accidental explosion of one of
    their charming playthings at the very crisis of the game. The
    racers of the after-guns had been out for their morning's
    exercise. Indeed the saddles had only just been removed, and
    the noble animals were now enjoying a good square meal of corn
    in their bombproof stable. Keep your animals in good fettle,
    and they'll never shirk their work: that was always my motto,
    and right well has it answered. The roaring furnaces, the
    cylindrical boilers, the prisoned steam, the twin screws, the
    steel shot that crashes like thunder, the fearful impact of the
    ram, the blanching terror of the supreme moment, the shattered
    limbs and scattered heads,&mdash;all these were ready, waiting
    but for the pressure of my finger on the middle button of the
    boatswain's mess-waistcoat to speed forth upon their deadly
    work between the illustrated covers of a shilling pamphlet.</p>

    <h3>CHAPTER IV.</h3>

    <p>In another moment the enemy's fleet had hove in sight. Our
    movements in the ten minutes preceding the fatal conflict will
    be best understood by consulting the annexed
    diagram:&mdash;</p>

    <div class="figright"
         style="width:40%;">
        <a href="images/160-2.png"><img width="100%"
             src="images/160-2.png"
             alt="Sailor thumbing nose." /></a>
    </div><p>We advanced in this imposing order for five minutes. Then
    came a puff of smoke, and, in less time than it takes to tell
    it, two thousand men had been literally blown into thin air,
    their sole remnant being the left shoe of my trusty second in
    command, Captain GLIMDOWSE. I trained the two turret-guns until
    I had got them into perfect condition, and gave the word. The
    crash that followed was terrific. One of the massive missiles
    went home, and stayed there, no amount of inducement availing
    to bring it out again to face the battle. The other, however,
    behaved as a British missile should, and exploded in the heart
    of the hostile fleet. The result was terrific. French, German
    and Russian Admirals by the thousand were destroyed, their
    scattered fragments literally darkening the face of the sun,
    and a mixed shower of iron, steel, stanchions, bollards,
    monster guns, Admirals, sailors, stewards, cocked-hats, and
    Post Captains fell for ten minutes without intermission from
    the clouds into which they had been driven by the awful
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page161"
       id="page161"></a>[pg 161]</span> force of the explosion. I
       turned to my Lieutenant, who was standing beside me, to give
       a necessary order. As I was about to address him, the
       machine-guns in the enemy's tops belched forth a myriad
       projectiles, and the unfortunate Lieutenant was swept into
       eternity. All that was left of him was his right hand,
       which, curiously enough, remained for a minute suspended in
       the air in its proper relative position to what had been the
       Lieutenant's body. I mastered my emotion with an effort, as
       I reverently grasped and shook the melancholy relic. Then,
       shedding a silent tear, I dropped it over the side, and with
       an aching heart, watched it disappear beneath the wave on
       which many of its former owner's happiest hours had been
       spent.</p>

    <h3>CHAPTER V.</h3>

    <p>This catastrophe ended the battle. The allied fleets had
    been swept off the face of the ocean. I packed what remained of
    H.M.S. <i>Bandersnatch</i> in my tobacco-pouch, attached myself
    to a hen-coop, and thus floated triumphantly into Portsmouth
    Harbour.</p>
    <hr />

    <h2>CHARLEMAGNE AND I.</h2>

    <p><i>Aix-la-Chapelle, Monday</i>.&mdash;I have always had a
    strange longing to know CHARLEMAGNE. To shake him by the hand,
    to have opportunity of inquiring after his health and that of
    his family, to hear his whispered reply&mdash;that indeed were
    bliss. But CHARLEMAGNE is dead, and desire must be curbed. The
    only thing open to an admirer is to visit the place of his last
    repose, and brood in spots his shade may yet haunt. CHARLEMAGNE
    was buried at Aix-la-Chapelle (German Aachen), but since my
    arrival in the town, I find great difficulty in discovering his
    tomb. The great soldier Emperor resembled an unfortunate and
    unskilful pickpocket in one respect. He was always being taken
    up. He died in the year 814, and was left undisturbed till the
    year 1000, when the Emperor OTTO THE THIRD opened his tomb,
    and, finding his great predecessor sitting on a marble chair,
    helped him down. The marble chair is on view in the Cathedral
    to this day (verger, I mark) to witness to the truth of this
    narrative. One hundred and sixty-five years later, FREDERICK
    BARBAROSSA opened the second tomb where OTHO had placed C., and
    transferred to a marble sarcophagus what, at this date, was
    left of him. In the following century C. was canonised.
    Whereupon nothing would satisfy FREDERICK THE SECOND but to go
    for the bones again. They were now growing scarce, and only a
    few fragments fill the reliquary in which at length all that is
    left of my revered friend (if after this lapse of time I may
    call him so) reposes.</p>

    <p>I have been fortunate in securing a relic, not exactly of
    CAROLO, but of the time at or about which he lived. It is a
    piece of tapestry, on which fingers long since dust have worked
    a sketch of the Emperor going to his bath. Considering its age,
    the tapestry is in remarkably fresh condition. The old Hebrew
    trader, whom for a consideration I induced to part with it,
    said he would not charge any more on that account; which I
    thought very considerate. He also said he might be able to get
    me some more pieces. But this, I think, will do to go on
    with.</p>

    <p>But if there be nothing left of CAROLO MAGNO, there still is
    the city he loved, in which he lived and died. Here is the
    Kaiserquelle, bubbling out of Büchel in which, centuries ago,
    he laved his lordly limbs. Going down into my bath this morning
    I observed in the dim light the imprint of a footstep on the
    marble stair.</p>

    <p>"That might have been CHARLEMAGNE'S," I said to YAHKOB, my
    bath attendant.</p>

    <p>"<i>Ja wohl</i>," said YAHKOB, nodding in his friendly way,
    and, going out, he presently returned with a hot towel.</p>

    <p>That did not seem to follow naturally upon my observation,
    which was, indeed, born of idle fancy. (I know very well C.'s
    death eventuated long prior to the building of the stately
    colonnade that fronts the present baths, and that therefore the
    footprint is illusory.) I am growing used to a certain
    irrelevancy in YAHKOB's conversation. My German is of the date
    of CHARLEMAGNE, and is no more understood here than is the
    Greek of SOCRATES in the streets of Athens. YAHKOB was
    especially told off for my service because he thoroughly
    understood and talked English. He says, "Ye-es" and "Ver well."
    But when I offer a chance remark he, three times out of five,
    nods intelligently, bolts off and brings me something
    back&mdash;a comb and brush, a newspaper, but oftenest, a hot
    towel. Once, when I asked him whether there were two posts a
    day to London, he lugged in an arm-chair.</p>

    <p>I get on better with WILLIAM. WILLIAM is a rubber&mdash;not
    of whist, <i>bien entendu</i>, but of men. In build WILLIAM is
    pear-shaped, the upper part of him, where you would expect to
    find the stalk, broadening out into a perpetual smile. He has
    lived in the Baths twenty-three years, and yet his gaiety is
    not eclipsed. If he has a foible it is his belief that he
    thoroughly understands London and its ways.</p>

    <p>"A ver big place," he remarked this morning, "where dey
    kills de ladees."</p>

    <p>This reference not being immediately clear, WILLIAM assisted
    dull comprehension by drawing his finger across his throat, and
    uttering a jovial "click!" But it was only when, his eyes
    brimming over with fun, he said, "YAK de Reeper," that I
    followed the drift of his remark.</p>

    <p>It is gratifying to the citizen of London travelling abroad,
    to learn that in the mind of the foreigner the great Metropolis
    is primarily and chiefly associated with "JACK the Ripper" and
    his exploits.</p>

    <p>"I rob you not hard," WILLIAM incidentally remarks, pounding
    at your chest as if it were a parquet flooring he was
    polishing; "but I strong so I can break a shentleman's
    ribs."</p>

    <p>I make due acknowledgment of the prowess, being particularly
    careful to refrain from expressing doubt, or even surprise.
    WILLIAM, always smiling, repeats the assertion just as if I had
    contradicted him. Try to change subject.</p>

    <div class="figright"
         style="width:40%;">
        <a href="images/161.png"><img width="100%"
             src="images/161.png"
             alt="I would break hees ribs!" /></a> "I would break hees ribs!"
    </div>

    <p>"I wonder if CHARLEMAGNE had a massage man in his suite?" I
    say, "and who was his Doctor? Now if he had had Dr. BRANDIS, I
    believe he would have been alive at this day. But we cannot
    have everything. CHARLEMAGNE had the Iron Crown of Lombardy; we
    have Dr. BRANDIS."</p>

    <p>"Y e e s," said WILLIAM, still gloating over his own train
    of thought; "eef I like I break a shentleman's ribs."</p>

    <p>Sometimes WILLIAM'S smile, contracting, breaks into a
    whistle, horribly out of tune. He rather fancies his musical
    powers, and is proud of his intimate acquaintance with the
    fashionable <i>chansons</i> current in London to-day, or as he
    puts it, "Vat dey shings at de Carrelton Clob." Then he warbles
    a line of the happily long-forgotten "Champagne CHARLIE," with
    intervals of "Oh what a surprise!" He sings both to the same
    tune, and fortunately knows only two lines of one and a single
    line of the other.</p>

    <p>Try to bring him back to CAROLO MAGNO.</p>

    <p>"Wouldn't you," I ask "give all you are worth to have lived
    in the time of CHARLEMAGNE? Suppose some day you walked into
    this room and discovered him sitting on his marble throne as
    OTHO found him with the Iron Crown on his head and his right
    hand grasping the imperial sceptre, what would you do?"</p>

    <p>"I would break hees ribs," said WILLIAM, his face illumined
    by a sudden flash of delighted anticipation.</p>

    <p>Alack! we are thinking of two personages sundered by
    centuries. My mind dwells on CHARLEMAGNE, whilst WILLIAM is
    evidently thinking of Champagne CHARLIE.</p>
    <hr />

    <h3>"ANNALS OF A VERY QUIET FAMILY."</h3>

    <p>There were eight of us, each within a year or so of one
    another.</p>

    <p>Father was a very quiet man, engaged all day in his
    study.</p>

    <p>Mother was equally quiet.</p>

    <p>Father would never allow a trumpet, drum, or any instrument
    of torture, except the piano, to be brought into the house.</p>

    <p>Mother quietly saw his orders carried out.</p>

    <p>In due course we all left home one after the other, and
    having been so quiet for so long, each one of us has contrived
    to make a considerable noise in the world since, and are all
    doing well. "Doing" may be used in the widest possible sense.
    Among other accomplishments we blow our own trumpets, as you
    see. As father and mother object to noise, we have not
    encouraged their visits.</p>

    <blockquote>
        ["We wanted, and we want, to do for the villages, what the
        first reformed Parliament did in conferring municipal
        government upon the towns. We knew that the Tory Party did
        not really mean to give us village or parish Councils....
        'The Radical agitators,' says Sir MICHAEL HICKS-BEACH,
        'want to see a complete change in the social condition of
        rural society.' What if we do?... Why, it was for this that
        many of us, seven or eight years ago, and many more years
        ago, fought for getting the labourer a vote."&mdash;<i>Mr.
        John Morley at Cambridge</i>.]

    <p class="center">SCENE&mdash;<i>The Forest of
    Ha</i>(<i>w</i>)<i>arden</i>.</p>

    <p><i>Touchstone</i> (Mr. J-HN M-RL-Y); <i>Audrey</i>, (The
    Agricultural Vote); <i>Jaques</i> (Mr. P-NCH), behind.
    Afterwards <i>William</i> (Sir M-CH-L H-CKS-B-CH.)</p>

    <p><i>Touch.</i> Come apace, good AUDREY: I will fetch up your
    votes, AUDREY. And how, AUDREY?&mdash;am I the man yet? Doth my
    simple programme content you?</p>

    <p><i>Audrey.</i> Your programme! Lord warrant us, what
    programme?</p>

    <p><i>Touch.</i> I am here with thee and thy Votes as the
    glittering poet-god Apollo was among the herds of Admetus.</p>

    <p><i>Jaq.</i> (<i>aside</i>). Oh, knowledge oddly applied!
    Fancy Olympian Oracles in a thatched cottage!</p>

    <p><i>Touch.</i> When a man's speeches cannot be understood,
    nor a man's good platform wit seconded by the froward child
    popular understanding, it strikes a man more dead than a small
    minority on a big Bill. Truly, I would the gods had made thee
    political.</p>

    <p><i>Aud.</i> I do not know what political is. Is it honest in
    deed and word? Is it a true thing?</p>

    <p><i>Touch.</i> (<i>with sardonic frankness</i>). No, truly;
    for the truest politics show the most feigning; and Tories are
    given to politics; and what they swear, in politics, may be
    said, as Tories, they do feign.</p>

    <p><i>Aud.</i> Do you wish, then, that the gods had made
    <i>me</i> political?</p>

    <p><i>Touch.</i> I do, truly; for they swear to me thou art
    true Tory, parson-and-squire-ridden Tory. Now, if thou wert
    political, I might have some hope thou didst feign&mdash;to
    <i>them</i>!</p>

    <p><i>Aud.</i> Would you not have me Tory?</p>

    <p><i>Touch.</i> No, truly, unless thou wert fortune-favoured;
    for Toryism coupled to poverty is to have folly a sauce to
    misery.</p>

    <p><i>Jaq.</i> (<i>aside</i>). A shrewd fool!</p>

    <p><i>Aud.</i> Well, I am not rich; and therefore I pray the
    gods to make me Liberal.</p>

    <p><i>Touch.</i> Truly, and to cast away Liberalism upon a
    willingly "unemancipated" Voter, were to deck a porker with
    pearls.</p>

    <p><i>Aud.</i> I may not be "emancipated," but I thank the gods
    I am "enfranchised."</p>

    <p><i>Touch.</i> Well, praised be the Liberals for thine
    enfranchisement! Emancipation&mdash;from "squarsonry"&mdash;may
    come hereafter. But, be it as it may, I will marry thee.</p>

    <p><i>Jaq.</i> (<i>aside</i>). I would fain see this wedding.
    Methinks there will be sport forward ere it be fully
    achieved.</p>

    <p><i>Aud.</i> Well, the gods give us joy!</p>

    <p><i>Touch.</i> Amen.... But, AUDREY, there is a youth here in
    the forest lays claim to you.</p>

    <p><i>Aud.</i> Ay, I know who 'tis: he hath no interest in me
    in the world. Here comes the man you mean.</p>

    <p><i>Touch.</i> It is meat and drink to me to see
    a&mdash;Tory: by my troth, we that have good wits have much to
    answer for; we shall be flouting; we cannot hold.</p>

    <p class="center"><i>Enter</i> WILLIAM.</p>

    <p><i>Will.</i> Good even, AUDREY.</p>

    <p><i>Aud.</i> Give ye good even, WILLIAM.</p>

    <p><i>Will.</i> And good even to you, Sir!</p>

    <p><i>Touch.</i> Good even, gentle friend.... Art thou
    wise?</p>

    <p><i>Will.</i> Ay, Sir, I have a pretty wit.</p>

    <p><i>Touch.</i> You do desire this maid?</p>

    <p><i>Will.</i> I do, Sir.</p>

    <p><i>Touch.</i> Give me your hand. Art thou learned?</p>

    <p><i>Will.</i> No, Sir.</p>

    <p><i>Touch.</i> Then learn this of me; to have is to have; for
    it is a great figure in Gladstonian rhetoric, that votes being
    deducted from one Party and added to another, by putting the
    one Out do put the other In; for all your writers do consent
    that <i>ipse</i> is he: now you are not <i>ipse</i>, for I am
    he.</p>

    <p><i>Will.</i> Which he, Sir?</p>

    <p><i>Touch.</i> He, Sir, that must marry the woman. Therefore,
    you Tory, abandon&mdash;which is, in the vulgar,
    leave&mdash;the society, which in the boorish is,
    company&mdash;of this female,&mdash;which in the common is,
    woman; which together is, abandon the society of this female,
    or Tory, thou vanishest; or, to thy better understanding,
    skedaddlest; or, to wit, I defeat thee, make thee away,
    translate thy majority into minority, thine Office into
    Opposition; I will deal in programmes with thee, or in
    eloquence, or in epigram; I will bandy with thee in faction; I
    will o'errun thee with policy; I will "mend thee or end thee" a
    hundred and fifty ways; therefore, tremble, and depart!</p>

    <h2>THE TRUE TENNYSON.</h2>

    <p>We have all been startled to find from the researches of Mr.
    WOODALL in <i>Notes and Queries</i>, that "Between the story
    sung by the Poet Laureate in his romantic poem <i>The Lord of
    Burleigh</i>, and the actual fact, there seems to be little in
    common." HENRY CECIL, Earl and afterwards Marquis of EXETER,
    married Miss SARAH HOGGINS under the name of JOHN JONES, having
    a wife alive at the time, and she did not die as the poem
    relates. It is obvious then that TENNYSON must be re-written,
    and we offer his Lordship the following humble suggestions.
    <i>The Lord of Burleigh</i> should henceforward run somewhat as
    follows:&mdash;</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p>Quoth he, "Gentle SARAH HOGGINS,"</p>

            <p class="i2">Speaking in seductive tones,</p>

            <p>"You must wed no HODGE or SCROGGINS,</p>

            <p class="i2">But espouse your own J. JONES."</p>

            <p>Oh! he was an artful party,</p>

            <p class="i2">And that marriage was a crime.</p>

            <p>He'd a wife alive and hearty,</p>

            <p class="i2">Though she'd left him for a time.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>The above discovery has, of course, led to doubts regarding
    other Tennysonian heroines. Was Lady CLARA VERE DE VERE, for
    example, as black as the poet has painted her? Perish the
    thought! Here are a couple of specimen stanzas for an amended
    version:&mdash;</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p>Lady CLARA VERE DE VERE,</p>

            <p class="i2">I vow that you were not a flirt,</p>

            <p>The daughter of a hundred Earls</p>

            <p class="i2">Would not a single creature hurt.</p>

            <p>"Kind hearts are more than coronets,"</p>

            <p class="i2">What abject twaddle, on my word;</p>

            <p>And then the joke is in the end,&mdash;</p>

            <p class="i2">We know they made the bard a Lord.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="stanza">
            <p>The tale of how young LAURENCE died,</p>

            <p class="i2">In some audacious print began;</p>

            <p>The fact is that he took to drink,</p>

            <p class="i2">He always was that sort of man.</p>

            <p>And as for ALFRED, why, of course</p>

            <p class="i2">You snubbed him; but was that a
            crime,</p>

            <p>That he should go and call you names,</p>

            <p class="i2">And print his atrabilious rhyme?</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>Then, again, was the <i>Amy</i> of <i>Locksley Hall</i>
    quite as shallow-hearted and so forth as the angry rhymester
    declares? It will probably turn out that she was not. Hence the
    verses should run in this fashion:&mdash;</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p>And I said, "My Cousin AMY, speak the truth, my
            heart to ease.</p>

            <p>Shall it be by banns or license?" And she whispered,
            "Which you please."</p>

            <p>Love took up the glass of Time and waved it gaily in
            the air,</p>

            <p>Married life was sweet at Number Twenty-Six in
            Camden Square.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="stanza">
          <p>AMY faithless! Bless your heart, Sir, that was not
            the case at all:</p>

            <p>It was pure imagination that I wrote in Locksley
            Hall.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>This process will doubtless have to be applied to many of
    the poems, but we must leave the congenial task to the
    Laureate.</p>

    <h3>POPULAR SONGS RE-SUNG;</h3>

    <h4>OR, MISS BOWDLER AT THE MUSIC HALLS.</h4>

    <h4>INTRODUCTORY.</h4>

    <p>DEAR MR. PUNCH,</p>

    <p>In these progressive days earnest reformers, especially
    those of the London County Council type, yearn to chasten and
    æstheticise the Muse of the Music Hall, who is perhaps the only
    really popular Muse of the period. My name gives me a sort of
    hereditary right to take exceptional interest in such matters,
    though indeed my respected, and respectable, ancestor is not in
    all things the model of his more catholic and cosmopolitan
    descendant. The McDougall regimen would doubtless be a little
    <i>too</i> drastic. To improve the Music-hall Song off the face
    of the earth, is an attempt which could only suggest itself to
    puritan fanaticism in its most arbitrary administrative form.
    The proletariat will not "willingly let die" the only Muse
    whose ministrations really "come home to its business and its
    bosom." No, Sir, the People's Pegasus cannot, must not be
    ruthlessly consigned to the knackers. But may it not be gently
    bitted, discreetly bridled, and taught to trot or amble with
    park-hack paces in the harness of Respectability?</p>

    <p>It is in this hope and faith that the following drawing-room
    versions of some of "the most popular Comic (and Sentimental)
    Songs of the Day" have been attempted by</p>

    <blockquote>
        Your respectful admirer,<br />
         VIRGINIA BOWDLER.
    </blockquote>

    <p>To the Respectable Citizen, the Moral Matron, and the Young
    Person, with a love of larkiness and lilt, but a distrust of
    politics, pugilism, and deep potations, the following eclectic
    adaptation of this prodigiously popular ballad may perhaps be
    not altogether unwelcome.</p>

    <p>No. I.&mdash;TWO LOVELY BROWN EYES,</p>

    <p>AIR&mdash;"<i>Two Lovely Black Eyes</i>".</p>

    <h2>JOURNAL OF A ROLLING STONE.</h2>

    <h3>NINTH ENTRY.</h3>

    <p>Curious thing, now that I am installed as a pupil in
    FIBBINS'S Chambers in Waste Paper Buildings, Temple, how few
    <i>new</i> briefs I am given to read. Usual routine is for DICK
    FIBBINS to hand me a brief on which the dust of ages has
    collected, and to leave me to "get up the law about it"; but
    when he (FIBBINS) comes back from his day's business in Court,
    about 4·30 P.M., he doesn't seem to care a bit to know what the
    law is. Seems tired, and prefers to gossip and smoke; so I do
    the same, or "follow on the same side," as he expresses it.</p>

    <p>"It strikes me forcibly," I begin, "that the Plaintiff,
    SMITHERS, in that running-down case you asked me to read
    to-day, hasn't got the ghost of a chance. Why, in
    <i>Blatherson</i> v. <i>Snipe</i>, the Court ruled&mdash;"</p>

    <p>"Tried the lawn-tennis in the gardens yet?" FIBBINS
    interrupts, in the rudest possible manner.</p>

    <p>"No," I reply, "I was speaking of the Court, not lawn-tennis
    courts." (One for FIBBINS, I think.) "All the Judges held in
    <i>Blatherson</i> v. <i>Snipe</i>, that&mdash;"</p>

    <p>"Oh, did they?" he interrupts again: "doosid interesting.
    Was I for plaintiff or defendant?"</p>

    <p>"Plaintiff, SMITHERS. A running-down case."</p>

    <p>"Wish it had been a running-up case&mdash;a case of
    running-up the fees," he laughs. Then, resuming a more
    professional style, "You see, I've had such multitudes of cases
    since then, that I've forgotten the precise details. But you
    write out your own Opinion&mdash;not to-day; tomorrow will do.
    Then I'll see what it's like. Now let's go a trot down the
    Strand."</p>

    <p>Another circumstance that strikes me as remarkable, is the
    frequency with which I hear the Impressive Clerk (in the little
    room next to mine) requesting persons who have called to
    "settle up that other little matter." Then the strange voice
    laughs, and says&mdash;"Oh, your Governor can wait." "No, he
    can't,"&mdash;it's the Clerk who says this&mdash;"it's been
    going on for three years, now." "Well," chimes in the unknown,
    "let it go a bit longer. When'll your Governor have settled
    those pleadings?" "When your people settle about the five
    guineas, and not before," replies the Impressive Clerk in his
    best Parliamentary debating style. Then follows a long wrangle,
    not on law, but on finance, which never&mdash;as far as I can
    judge&mdash;ends in the Clerk getting his way, and his
    money.</p>

    <div class="figright"
         style="width:40%;">
        <a href="images/168.png"><img width="100%"
             src="images/168.png"
             alt="Looks like a Prime Minister in reduced circumstances." />
        </a> "Looks like a Prime Minister in reduced
        circumstances."
    </div>

    <p>Astonishing event happens. A real live new brief comes in!
    Impressive Clerk&mdash;who looks like a Prime Minister in
    reduced circumstances&mdash;brings it to FIBBINS when I am in
    the room. More impressive than ever. "From ROGERS, in Chancery
    Lane&mdash;an excellent firm, Sir," he says. Poor FIBBINS
    tries, ineffectually, to conceal his delight, and his eye turns
    instinctively to the place where the fee is marked.</p>

    <p>"Six guas" (legal slang for guineas) "for an Opinion, not
    bad," he comments, rubbing his hands. FIBBINS dusts a corner of
    his desk, and lays it down there.</p>

    <p><i>I</i> am given this precious brief, and am asked to write
    a "draft Opinion" about it! "Just to try your hand," says
    FIBBINS, who does not wish me to be conceited. "Then I'll write
    my own afterwards," he adds.</p>

    <p>I make a very elaborate commentary, quoting from innumerable
    parallel cases in English, American, and Roman law, and, after
    giving it to DICK FIBBINS to read, I don't see it again.</p>

    <p>But, a few afternoons later, when Impressive Clerk happens
    to be out, a knock comes. Nobody in. At last, go myself
    (<i>Query</i>&mdash;infra dig.?) and open door.</p>

    <p>"Here!" says a juvenile, who apparently mistakes me for the
    Clerk, and rudely chucks some papers to me, which hit me in the
    chest, "give these to your Governor. What a time you take
    answering a knock! Having a nap, hay? Take care old FIBBINS
    don't catch you at it, that's all!" Juvenile disappears
    downstairs, whistling, before I can think of a suitable
    rejoinder.</p>

    <p>Open the papers. The same brief returned with request to
    "draw up a Statement of Claim,"&mdash;and my "Opinion" inside!
    It looks as if DICK sent these clients of his <i>my</i>
    valuable advice, pretending that it was his own!</p>

    <p>My learned "leader," when he comes in, treats affair very
    coolly.</p>

    <p>"Oh, did I send <i>your</i> 'Opinion' to them as well as
    mine? What an ass I am! I wonder what they thought of it?"</p>

    <p>I also wonder. In looking over the returned brief just now,
    however, I certainly did not come across the "Opinion,"
    manufactured by FIBBINS himself, of which that learned Counsel
    spoke. And I have no second chance of examining it, as he is
    careful to take "all the documents in the case" (a phrase of
    the Impressive Clerk's) home with him, for what he calls
    re-perusal.</p>

    <p>The conviction that it <i>was</i> my Opinion, and mine
    alone, which FIBBINS dispatched, probably out of sheer
    laziness, to ROGERS &amp; CO., Solicitors, Chancery Lane, is
    one that I still retain. But it is FIBBINS who retains the
    fee!</p>

    <h3>AT THE CLOSE OF THE SUMMER.</h3>

    <p class="center">(<i>By one who idled. To his Lady-help.</i>)</p>
    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p>I am back at my work, which is far from exciting</p>

            <p class="i2">After nothing to do for a month at a
            time,</p>

            <p>So I am not astonished to find myself writing</p>

            <p class="i2">To you, dear MELENDA, and writing in
            rhyme.</p>

            <p>In my rooms very often the scent of the heather</p>

            <p class="i2">Brings back with it sweet recollections,
            and so</p>

            <p>I think of the days when we idled together,</p>

            <p class="i2">Far away in the country a fortnight
            ago.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="stanza">
            <p>Yes, the two afternoons when, although we were
            sorry</p>

            <p class="i2">That it rained, we went out as to do we
            had vowed,</p>

            <p>And the wonderful echo we found in a quarry</p>

            <p class="i2">That took what we whispered and said it
            aloud.</p>

            <p>Whilst we wandered through fern-laden hedges and
            talked, it</p>

            <p class="i2">So happened a dragon-fly flew by your
            side.</p>

            <p>You remember, I'm sure, how you laughed as I stalked
            it,</p>

            <p class="i2">And how it seemed hurt, as it finally
            died.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="stanza">
            <p>Then I think of our pic-nic. The sunshine came
            glinting,</p>

            <p class="i2">And we thought that the summer had
            come&mdash;come to stay.</p>

            <p>We did not walk too fast, you were constantly
            hinting</p>

            <p class="i2">You were really afraid we were losing our
            way.</p>

            <p>I seemed to be catching two glimpses of heaven,</p>

            <p class="i2">As I gazed at the sky and kept looking at
            you;</p>

            <p>For the party that started by being just seven</p>

            <p class="i2">Had a curious habit of shrinking to
            two.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="stanza">
            <p>Why, that's quite sentimental. It isn't the
            fashion</p>

            <p class="i2">To write of such things in so high flown
            a style.</p>

            <p>Yet maybe I'm entitled to so much of passion</p>

            <p class="i2">As to say that you won me outright with
            your smile.</p>

            <p>Though a merciless fate may not let it befall
            so,</p>

            <p class="i2">For we know not at all what there may be
            in store,</p>

            <p>Yet next year, if you're down there&mdash;and I am
            there also,</p>

            <p class="i2">Shall we do what we did in the summer
            before?</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
